# Cold neovim configs

What to work on:
- [x] Pick the plugins I wanna use
- [x] Add plugins that aren't in nixpkgs
- [x] Write a wrapper around my config as a plugin
- [ ] Create a config framework (change name to kaizen)
- [ ] Create very basic neovim configuration without plugins for now
- [ ] Create configurations for said plugins, one by one, modules
- [ ] Enjoy!

## Flake packages:
- `.#zima`
- `.#default` (points to zima)

## Plugins
